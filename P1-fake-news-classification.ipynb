        "## Introduction\n",
        "In this project we will build an **n-gram-based language model** for fake news classification. We will also investigate a feature-based **Naive Bayes model**. The task we are faced with is to **decide whether a news article is fake or real**. While some fake articles are so absurd and nonsensical that one can clearly guess they are fake, most fake news is actually quite hard to detect. [Various studies](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/research/program-on-democracy-and-the-internet/deception-detection-accuracy-for-fake-news-headlines-on-social-media/) have shown that most people can have an error rate up to 50% depending on the theme of the article. \n",
        "\n",
        "To help us approach this problem, we will use NLP techniques covered thus far to frame this as a (supervised) binary classification task, where each article will have a label $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where *0 indicates a fake article* and *1 indicates a real one*. You will train and validate your two different models and then run them on a test data set with hidden $y$ labels. You will then submit the results on the test data set to Kaggle to participate in our class-wide competition!\n",
        "\n",
        "The project is divided into six parts:\n",
        "1. Dataset loading and preprocessing\n",
        "2. Unsmoothed n-gram language model (LM): build the unsmoothed n-gram language model using our Fake News corpus. \n",
        "3. Smoothed n-gram language model: build a smoothed version of the model from part 2.\n",
        "4. Perplexity: compute perplexity for both the unsmoothed and smoothed model\n",
        "5. Putting everything together and submitting the first model to Kaggle\n",
        "6. Naive Bayes: build a feature-based Naive Bayes model to perform the same classification task. Compare the LM with Naive Bayes and identify the pros and cons of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Logistics:** You should work in **groups of 2 students**. Students in the same group will get the same grade. Thus, you should make sure that everyone in your group contributes to the project. \n",
        "- **Remember to form groups on BOTH CMS and Gradescope** or not all group members will receive grades. You can use the Teammate Search option on Piazza to find a partner for this project.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advice:** Please complete the written parts of this notebook in a clear and informative way. This is where you get to show us that you understand not only what you are doing but also why and how you are doing it. So be clear, organized and concise; avoid vagueness and excess verbiage. Spend time\n",
        "doing error analysis for the models. This is how you understand the advantages and drawbacks of the systems you build. \n",
        "- It's also useful to think about how the theory of n-grams/Naive Bayes bridges with the real world application we are building. Think about what you expect from these models based on your current understanding, and then see if your expectation aligns with empirical results that you'll get. "

        "\n",
        "There's a well-known parable in machine learning that 80% of the work is all about data preparation, 10% is supporting infrastructure and 10% is actual modeling. If your \"raw\" dataset is not preprocessed and prepared in a way to maximize its value, then your model will be more like this: https://xkcd.com/1838/. For this project, modeling is the star of the show for learning purposes, but we still want you to pay attention to the preprocessing stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "*We've already tokenized and lowercased* the raw data for you. Here are a few extra things you might want to do:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Think about edge cases. For example, you don't want to accidentally append a period to the last word of a sentence. \n",
        "- Watch out for apostrophes and other tricky things like quotations, they cause lots of edge cases. For example, \"they're\" can be all one token, or two tokens (\"they\", \"'re\") or even three tokens (\"they\", \" ' \", \"re\"). \n",
        "\n",
        "Why did we lowercase all tokens? Because the computer will otherwise consider \"The\" and \"the\" as two separate words and this will cause problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that you may use existing\n",
        "tools just for the purpose of preprocessing. \n",
        "\n",
        "Advice: don't get bugged down in the dozens of preprocessing packages and suggestions that you can find on Towards Data Science or Stack Overflow. Start with this [NLTK tutorial](https://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/cs.pitt.edu/projects/nltk/docs/tutorial/introduction/nochunks.html#:~:text=The%20Natural%20Language%20Toolkit%20(NLTK,tokenization%2C%20tagging%2C%20and%20parsing.) and that should be plenty."

The first occurrences were tracked by using a vocab set. As we pre-processed the words, we checked if they were in our vocab set. If they were not, we made that word to be \\<UNK> and added them to the vocab set.\n"

With that, we determined that k=0.001 will be better for all of our models. Making k lower than 0.001 barely made a difference in perplexity for all the models.
